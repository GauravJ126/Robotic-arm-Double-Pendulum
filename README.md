# Robotic-arm-Double-Pendulum

This was the initial stage of the Automatic Chess Board project. 

Here you will get the 3D model and the Python code that implements the math for finding the angular difference between two positions on the plain.
You can find the code in arm_math and arm_test in the repo.
